2003-06-22 14:55  andy

	* src/dnsbl.c: ...the effect is that bopm will use the else clause

2003-06-19 17:12  dgl

	* src/: config.c, config.h, dnsbl.c, firedns.c, firedns.h, main.c,

	  little warning fixes (with ./configure --extra-fascism), mostly
	  for firedns.

2003-06-19 16:30  dgl

	* src/: dnsbl.c, firedns.c, firedns.h: Reorganisation of the DNS
	  code so it's a bit easier to read, and several bugs fixed: the
	  lookup is aborted if it can't send the lookup and the fd limit is
	  also correctly dealt with.  Several API changes and a new error
	  for fd limit reached.

2003-06-17 20:10  dgl

	* src/firedns.c: firedns_getip{4,6} are meant to return an fd..

2003-06-17 20:02  dgl

2003-06-17 19:56  dgl

2003-06-17 13:47  andy

	* bopm.conf.sample: Better keep it commented out.

2003-06-17 13:32  andy

	  Portability fixes for Sun Forte compiler:

	  - No C++ comments - No inline - Don't initialize values of an

	  NOTE: I have not added in any of the firedns parts yet - we need

	* bopm.conf.sample, src/config-parser.y, src/dnsbl.c,

	  tabs and not tabs..) - Made firedns_resolveip4 accept IP as input
	  (firedns really is getting messy) - Added missing target_port to
	  scanner block stuff (now documented too) - DNSBL lookups no
	  longer print timeout error to the channel

	  src/firedns.c, src/firedns.h, src/inet.c, src/inet.h, src/irc.c,
	  src/main.c, src/scan.c, src/stats.c: Lots of mostly DNS related
	  changes

	  dnsbl.{c,h}: - Many changes to accomdate configurable output from
	  blacklists - Return values from DNSBLs must now be set in the
	  configuration file,	they are not hardcoded - It is possible to
	  ignore some of the results returned from DNSBLs - Lookup errors
	  are now sent to channels as errors as well as to the log - The
	  void pointer passed to firedns is now a dnsbl_scan struct
	  (contains   a pointer to the blacklist and to the scan_struct).

	  firedns.{c,h}: - firedns.conf is now read from the BOPM
	  configuration dir   (etc/firedns.conf) not the system wide /etc.
	    (firedns.conf is just a list of IP addresses, one on each line)
	   - Fixes to make firedns.conf work in a sane way - Better errors
	  when problems occur reading configuration files -
	  firedns_resolveip4 fixed to actually work - new error: Network
	  error, for errors receiving from the dns server

	  inet.{c,h}, irc.c, scan.c, main.c: - bopm_gethostbyname removed,
	  code uses firedns_resolveip4 now - DNS lookup code adjusted to
	  use firedns

	  scan.c: - %t in kline format strings - the type of proxy found on
	  the host   works for both DNSBL results and proxies found by BOPM

	  configuation: - Added new blacklist directives (this breaks old
	  config files).  - scanner blocks now inherit settings from _the
	  one above them_,   this saves multiple definitions of the same
	  thing in different   scanner blocks (this affects vhost, fd,
	  target_ip, target_port,   timeout, max_read and target_strning in
	  scanner blocks).

2003-04-07 23:51  strtok

	* src/config-lexer.l:

	  size of int/long.  Work out what type to use for a 32-bit int.
	  Regenerate autotools.

2003-03-07 00:37  dgl

	* src/firedns.c: Of course, you need an extra header file for that
	  to work..  so changing int32_t to int.  (I blame vim's syntax
	  hilighting for lulling me into a false sense of security, but
	  probably testing stuff with the exact code you commit is also a
	  good idea).

2003-03-06 23:59  dgl

	* src/firedns.c: Fix for a weird bug exposed by running on alpha -
	  the returned record would only have 2 bytes, so it appeared that
	  the proxy had no type.

	  This happens because firedns assumes that long = 4 bytes, so the
	  temp. fix changes long -> int32_t.

	  Thanks to Chainsaw for trusting the BOPM developers with a shell
	  account on his machine ;-).

	* src/opercmd.c: Make sure that the param string is at least null

2002-08-23 06:42  andy

	* src/: negcache.c, negcache.h: src/negcache.[ch]:
	  Implementation of a patricia trie for storing IP addresses and
	  timestamps.  This data structure will allow searches for nodes
	  with only log_2 N bit comparisons where N is the current number
	  of	  nodes.  It also only requires as many nodes as there are
	  IP	 addresses to store.

		  Each node stores a key (the IP address), a timestamp, the
	  bit
		  index, and left and right branches.  The bit index is
	  what makes
		  this different from a radix search tree, it tells us at
	  which bit
		  this node's key differs from those above it in the trie.

		  Properties of the trie:
		    1) The bit index always decreases as we follow the tree
	  from the head
		       to an external node.
		    2) Each branch of an external node points to the only
	  node that can
		       contain keys that match the bit pattern.  All
	  searches terminate
		       at external nodes.
		    3) When trying to search for a bit pattern that is not
	  present in the
		       tree, you will hit an external node at the place
	  where your bit
		       pattern first deviates from all current nodes.  You
	  can tell this
		       has happened because the next node's bit index will
	  be larger than
		       the current, which would be contrary to point (1).
		    4) Because the bit increments in each node store
	  information about
		       where each node's bit pattern differs from all
	  others in the tree,
		       extra nodes are not needed - unlike in a radix tree.
		    5) As for a radix tree, a patricia trie will always end
	  up the
		       same no matter what order the nodes are inserted.

2002-08-23 05:41  andy

	* src/scan.c: src/scan.c:	scans_active_for_addr() - walk the
	  scan list and check if there are     any other scans in progress
	  for a given IP address (as specified in     dot quad format).

		  When a scan fails and negative caching is enabled, check
	  if there
		  are other scans in progress for the same address.  If
	  not, all
		  scans have failed and an entry should be added in the
	  negcache.

		  Walking the list after every scan seems inefficient but I
	  can't see
		  any other way to tell if there are no more scans active.
	  So, at
		  the moment this is a good reason for not using negative
	  caching.

2002-08-23 05:29  andy

	* src/options.h: src/options.h	NEG_CACHE_REBUILD: how long in
	  seconds between rebuilds of the  negcache, if enabled.

2002-08-23 05:28  andy

	* src/main.c: src/main.c:	Periodically rebuild the negcache
	  (if enabled) to remove entries	that are too old.  Note
	  that even though this might only happen	  every 12 hours or
	  so, old entries are ignored by nc_search()	anyway.  This is
	  just to free up some memory.

2002-08-23 05:17  andy

	* src/irc.c: src/irc.c: 	Upon connection to the IRC server,
	  initialise our negative cache        (if negative caching is
	  enabled).

		  When a user connection is detected, search for their IP
	  in our
		  negative cache (if negative caching is enabled).  If it
	  is present,
		  say so in the logfile and don't bother to scan them.

		  Note that negative caching is only implemented for IPv4
	  at the
		  moment -- shouldn't be hard to extend it to IPv6 though.

2002-08-23 05:12  andy

	* src/config.c: src/config.c:	CONF_NEG_CACHE stores the value of
	  the NEG_CACHE directive from	       the config.

2002-08-23 05:11  andy

2002-08-23 05:10  andy

	* src/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Makefile.in, src/Makefile.am,

	* bopm.conf.sample: bopm.conf.sample:	Documentation for new

	  USE OF NEGATIVE CACHING!

2002-08-15 18:22  andy

	* README: README:	Typo.

2002-08-15 18:16  andy

	* README: README:	Added a requirements section, specifically
	  something about transparent  proxies.  This has been mentioned on
	  the lists before but should	     probably be in the README
	  since we have just discovered a host whose	BOPM K:lined 100%
	  of users due to it being behind a transparent web	proxy. (!)

2002-08-15 13:22  andy

	  src/dlclist.h, src/extern.h, src/irc.c, src/main.c,
	  src/options.h, src/scanwarn.c, src/scanwarn.h: bopm.conf.sample:
	     Document SCAN_WARNING directive.

	  src/config/h:   Added new config directive type, TYPE_WILDLIST.
	  This will be like a	 linked list, but specifically for
	  wildcards (which is the only use we	had for lists before now).
	  They are special because they a) need       wildcards collapsed
	  and b) don't allow duplicate wildcards.

		  Normal linked lists will be of TYPE_LIST.

	  src/config.c:   Rewrote add_to_list() and general linked list
	  implementation as we	    believe it has never worked.

		  Added CONF_SCAN_WARNING to hold linked list of notices
	  from the
		  SCAN_WARNING config directive.

		  New linked list code needs an init_lists() function to
	  allocate the
		  heads of all linked lists.

	  src/extern.h:   Added CONF_SCAN_WARNING.

	  src/irc.c:	  Updated CONF_EXCLUDE code to match new linked
	  list implementation.

		  Removed some left over debug code.

	  src/main.c:	  Added a new function, scanwarn_timer(), in the
	  alarm loop.  This	   function will get called once a second
	  and will empty the notice	   queue (described later).

	  src/options.h:  Added option for how many notices to send per
	  second.

	  src/dlclist.[ch]:	  Implementation of generic doubly-linked
	  circular lists.

	  src/scanwarn.[ch]:	  Maintain a queue of pending notices to be
	  sent regarding scanning.	A doubly-linked circular list is
	  used as a queue, new notices added	 after the head and removed
	  from before the head.

2002-08-13 04:28  andy

	  to dissect_time wrong!

2002-08-09 06:11  andy

	* src/scan.c: src/scan.c:	addr is a STRING containing the IP
	  address, casting it to       "struct in_addr *" is not going to

	  match.h, scan.c:
	  match.c, match.h: IRC wildcard matching functions from
	  dancer-hybrid.  match() handles string matching and collapse()
	  shortens a wildcard string as far as possible.

	  config.h: Added new config type; TYPE_LIST.  Multiple parameters
	  of this type are put into a linked list.

	  Added missing config_memfail() prototype.

	  config.c: Added new config option EXCLUDE.  This is a list of

	  will not be scanned.

	  Makefile.in: Added new objects and dependencies for match.[cho]

	  irc.c, irc.h: Added do_connect() function to avoid duplication.
	  This function checks the users host and IP address against the
	  EXCLUDE list and provided there are no matches proceeds to do a
	  DNSBL check and proxy scan.

	  The above patch was contributed by Rob Levin/lilo @ OPN

	  to distribute the configure	     script at some point instead
	  of just configure.in and expect people     to use autoconf; we'll
	  have to remember to change this then.

	  config.c, dnsbl.c, irc.c, log.c, main.c, opercmd.c, scan.c:
	  Take account of AC_HEADER_STDC check.

2002-02-13 19:58  andy

	  bopm to use a different name for log, pid and config files.  i.e.
	  ./bopm -c myserver will use myserver.conf, myserver.log,
	  myserver.pid.

	  The patch also makes bopm set umode -h on itself after opering,
	  in order to prevent the bot appearing in /stats p output (shows
	  opers available to help).

	  bopchecker now takes the -c option also, in the same way as bopm.

	  stats.h: Support for oper-only commands.

	  We keep a list of command structures, each oper command is placed
	  into the first free structure and then a /userhost is issued.

	  When the reply from userhost is received and the user verified as
	  an oper then the command can be executed, otherwise it should be
	  ignored.  Then the command structure may be cleared and any
	  dynamic memory freed.

	  We may receive userhost replies with no data, indicating that the
	  nick left the network before we could check them.  Since we can't
	  tell who it is, we need to periodically (in this case, every 2
	  minutes) go through our command list and remove any commands that
	  have not been executed in that period.

	  dissect_time() also moved to misc.c, now that it is used by more
	  than just the stats functions.

	  Current limitation: oper commands may have only one parameter.
